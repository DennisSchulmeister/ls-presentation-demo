lecture-slides.js Presentation Demo
===================================

Getting Started
---------------

This is a tiny showcase of the `lecture-slides.js` features. In order to install
the needed dependencies open a terminal, cd to the directory where this project
lives and run the following command:

    $ npm install

Each HTML file is a single presentation showcasing certain features or plugins.
You can use the built-in web server to run the slides:

    $ npm run start

This will run a web server, listening on http://localhost:8080

Uploading to a Web Server
-------------------------

Once you are done, build a static version and upload it to any web server:

    $ npm run build

Copyright
---------

`lecture-slides.js` uses the Affero GPL 3. This example however uses a
3-clause BSD license, because you may not want to use the GPL on your slides.
:-) Well if you do, hat off to you, but of course you don't have to.
